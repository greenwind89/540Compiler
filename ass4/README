Write-up for PA4
----------------

In the good.cl and bad.cl, we input 3 classes with inheritance structure. In each class, it will have expressions.
If the expression coverage 100% correct in a .cl file, it regarded as correct structure. If not, out AST will annotate the incorrect expression.

SELF_TYPE in case of new, if it is correct with the parent case it will always be correct with children case so we only need to check SELF_TYPE in this case with parent type

Due to the mismatch between Complement and Negation derived from parser, in this assignment, we follow the erro by implement checking of neg in comp_classa and vice versa.
